# Carbon-Footprint
A project with scripts to methodically calculate the Carbon Footprint of Workflow Executions from Nextflow trace files.

## Dependencies
You can install the necessary dependencies with:
```bash
uv sync
```
After that you can also run each command without `uv run`, provided you did not activate another environment. You can activate it via `source .venv/bin/activate`.

## Usage
For the current version, replicating the previous calculation approach noted in the Credits section, example usage has been provided with default values:
```bash
uv run python -m src.scripts.IchnosCF <trace-name> <ci-value|ci-file-name> <power_model> <? interval=60> <? pue=1.0> <? memory-coeff=0.392>
uv run python -m src.scripts.IchnosCF ampliseq-1 uk-marg-010125-110225 gpg_15_powersave_linear 5 1.0 0.392
```
or with a configuration file, like [config.yaml](example/config.yaml):
```bash
uv run python -m src.scripts.IchnosCF -c <path/to/your/config.yaml>
```

> **Note**  
> The trace file name must be the file name only, and traces should be csv files stored in the [data trace](data/trace/) directory!

> **Note**  
> The trace file must use raw data values, e.g. duration recorded in ms, this is possible by using the trace.raw flag when executing a nextflow workflow. 

## Output
The script will produce two files. If the trace file name was 'test', then 'test-trace.csv' would produce a csv file of Carbon Records with energy consumption (inc. PUE) and carbon footprint for each task in the trace file. The 'test-summary.txt' file will contain details around the provided parameters (e.g. CI, PUE) and the overall energy, memory and carbon footprint.     
See the [test-summary](output/test-summary.txt) and [test-trace](output/test-trace.csv). 

## Extras
Using the [convertor](src/scripts/Convertor.py) we can create updated trace files with an updated timestamp (only altering for the same day by a number of hours and minutes at present) to show how Carbon Intensity affects the Carbon Footprint over a day (or some given period in the future).   
See example output:
```bash
uv run python3 -m src.scripts.Convertor nf-rangeland-21-1.txt - 6 0 \;
uv run python3 -m src.scripts.Convertor nf-rangeland-21-1.txt + 6 0 \;
```
