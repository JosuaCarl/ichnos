    Calculate the embodied carbon for a CPU model based on its usage duration and expected lifetime. Currently assumes 100% CPU utilisation of all cores.
    
    Parameters:
    cpu_model (str): The model of the CPU.
    duration_used (float): The duration the CPU has been used in time units; only used as a ratio so units don't matter, unless no lifetime is provided, then the unit has to be hours.
    lifetime (float): The expected lifetime of the CPU in time units. If None, defaults to 5 years (in hours).
    cpu_usage (float): The percentage of CPU usage (0.0 to 1.0). Defaults to 1.0 (100% usage).
